We frequently feature interviews with public officials, scholars, and authors, and I am writing to you today because I am wondering if one of our staff writers could speak with you over the phone for an interview. We would love to discuss your career in government, transition to the Center for American Progress, and maybe even some of your favorite bands. Here’s a little background on our magazine: The Politic is Yale’s undergraduate political publication. Since 1947, we have been an outlet for the politically inclined on Yale’s campus, with past editors-in-chief including Fareed Zakaria, Gideon Rose, and Robert Kagan. We publish four times a year, featuring long-form investigative articles. We pride ourselves on speaking with this country’s—and the world’s—foremost public servants, policy makers, and intellectuals. In the past, The Politic has interviewed President Obama, Secretary Kerry, President Zedillo of Mexico, and many more. We recently concluded the largest and most rewarding project in our history, interviewing over 100 United States Ambassadors in a series entitled “Diplomatic Discourse,” which has received international attention, from the U.S. Department of State to media outlets worldwide.

Dear Mr. Quan,
The U.S. Office of Financial Research and the University of Michigan's Center on Finance, Law, and Policy
invite you to serve as a panelist at our upcoming financial stability conference.
""Fin Tech Risks and Opportunities: An Interdisciplinary Approach,"" will take place at the University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor, Michigan from Thursday, November 16 - Friday, November 17, 2017. This two-day event will
bring together a wide range of researchers, policymakers, students, and practitioners from various disciplines.
Financial technology, or Fin Tech, can be traced back to the introduction of the telegraph in the 1860s.
Between then and the 1980s, most FinTech advancements were record-keeping and data systems found in
the back offices of financial institutions, out of sight of the public. As internet technology became more
available, however, FinTech evolved rapidly. Financial firms digitized their processes, and companies began
introducing consumer-facing products such as online banking and PayPal. Today, FinTech continues to disrupt
and to evolve, not only in how financial products and services are delivered, but who delivers them. Regulators
and market participants face challenges in understanding and balancing the benefits of FinTech against
Page 1 of 50
potential risks.
Innovation helps catalyze growth and new opportunities while generating new risks. Regulatory structures in
place could fail to accommodate changes in the financial marketplace. Regulators may overreact to new
technologies, stifling innovation and locking in old forms of doing business. At the same time, regulatory
complacency can have disastrous results, permitting the buildup of systemic risk or widespread consumer
harms. This conference will explore methodologies that the private sector, researchers, and policymakers can
use harness the upside potential of financial innovation while reducing the downside risks.
The symposium format will include keynote speakers and panel discussions. We invite you to make a short
presentation about your work as part of Panel 5, ""Reg Tech: How Can Regulators Be Part of the Solution?"" A
moderated discussion with an audience question and answer session will follow the panel.
All speakers are invited to a pre-conference dinner the evening of Wednesday November 15, and a larger
dinner on Thursday, November 16. The University of Michigan will cover your conference travel and hotel

Notice of Data Breach
Dear [Member],
This letter is to inform you of a data security incident that impacted the username and salted and hashed password you may have used to access your American Bar Association (“ABA”) online account. The ABA takes the security of your information very seriously and sincerely apologizes for any concern this incident may cause. While the ABA has no indication that your personal information has been misused, this letter contains information about what occurred, actions that have been taken to prevent a reoccurrence, and steps you can take to protect your information.​
oag.ca.gov
What happened?
On March 17, 2023, the ABA observed unusual activity on its network and immediately activated its incident response plan. Cybersecurity experts were retained to assist with the investigation. The investigation determined that an unauthorized third party gained access to the ABA network beginning on or about March 6, 2023, and may have acquired certain information. By March 23, 2023, the investigation identified that the unauthorized party had acquired usernames and hashed and salted passwords that you may have used to access ABA online accounts.​
oag.ca.gov
What information was involved?
The information involved was the username and hashed and salted password you used to log into the ABA website. To be clear, passwords were not exposed in plain text – they were stored in a protected (hashed and salted) form. The ABA is notifying all affected individuals out of an abundance of caution. (If you reused the same credentials on the new ABA website, please update your password.)​

What we are doing.
The ABA has taken measures to secure its systems and prevent future attacks. We removed the unauthorized access, engaged cybersecurity specialists, and reviewed our network security configurations to address evolving threats.​

What you can do.
Although we have no evidence of misuse of your information, we encourage you to change any password that is similar to the one involved in this incident. Please remain vigilant for any unauthorized attempts to access your accounts. If you use the ABA Career Center, consider changing that password as well.

Dear MoveOn member,

After Super Tuesday's results and yesterday's news that Governor Mitt
Romney dropped out of the presidential race, it's clear that Senator John
McCain will be the Republican nominee.

And while the election is a long way off, he's running neck and neck with
Clinton and Obama in national polls. That's because when people think of
McCain, they think of the media portrayal as a ""maverick""--they don't
think of him as the man who helped George Bush launch the Iraq war.

But a new memo from VoteVets.org shows that when it comes to the war in
Iraq, John McCain has been the president's greatest ally from the
get-go--and most striking is the fact that his plan for Iraq going forward
is the same as Bush's: Stay indefinitely.

Take a moment to read the memo, below--you won't regret it. Then, we're
asking folks to get the word out--can you pledge to pass it on to your
friends and colleagues? The more people that know about McCain's
positions, the better.

Yes, I'll pass this on to my friends.

No, sorry.

I'm also copying the memo below this email, so you can read it here.

legitimate,95,"Subject: University Remote Work Policy Update
Dear colleagues,

I am writing to share an update to the University’s policy on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs), and more specifically, remote work. While University Services is committed to delivering services in person, and we only have a handful of employees who work remotely, I wanted to share with all of you the details around this policy change.

As of September 1, 2023, the University’s guidance will change from allowing up to 2 to allowing up to only 1 remote workday per week, unless certain exceptions apply. For some other departments, this is a significant change. My goal with this email is to share the rationale for this decision.

This decision follows 18 months of analysis and discussion by Cabinet units regarding Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) for remote work. Along with our colleagues across the campus, we assessed the extent to which our current remote work approach is working well, and where it has raised challenges for Princeton’s fundamentally residential and in-person academic mission.

We have collectively determined that our current allowance is not optimal for maintaining principal and consistent in-person and on-site presence across University departments, which is essential to supporting Princeton’s culture and its research and teaching mission. To be sure, the pandemic has taught us all that there is value in remote work flexibility, which is why the new guidance will allow for one day of remote work per week. Moreover, the University recognizes the need for greater flexibility in some specific and limited circumstances, which is why the new policy articulates criteria for remote work beyond one day a week.

The goal of this new approach is to optimize operations, to prevent the fraying of our University’s culture, to foster the development of and sustained meaningful professional connections that enable individual and collective excellence, and to maintain important flexibility for individuals, based on job and operational allowability. The policy seeks to better align for the long term the University’s work environment with our cultural commitment to performance excellence, professional development, collaboration, colleagueship, and high service levels in furtherance of the University’s educational mission.

Accordingly, the updated remote work guidance will shift by September 1, 2023 to a maximum of 1 remote workday each week, job allowable, unless a unit’s Cabinet officer approves an exception for specific individuals and roles based on the strict criteria set forth below.

Cabinet Officer Exception Criteria Beyond 1 Day Per Week Remote For Recurring Remote Work:

Space limitations and physical constraints at work location such that there is not available workspace for the employees designated for remote work.
Acute/persistent recruitment markets for specific jobs/industries wherein additional remote work time has become normalized such that denying remote work would significantly compromise our ability to hire and/or attract and retain appropriately qualified staff; this determination must be made in consultation with HR Talent Acquisition and will be reviewed periodically.
Significant performance and productivity improvement supported by clear and documented evidence/data for specific types of jobs. This is intended to be a rare exception applicable to a very small number of jobs at the University given the importance of in-person collaboration in general.
Temporary circumstances (including changes in staffing needs during specific seasonal periods, such as outside the academic year, or other specific short-term situations, typically 3 months or shorter in duration) or transitions for planned separations such as phased retirements.
All exceptions granted to individuals to enable remote work for more than one day per week will be subject to periodic review at least every 6 months, as is the case with all FWAs. As is true with respect to all flexible work arrangements under our policy, the “University retains discretion to discontinue FWAs in the best interest of the unit/department at any time.”

As a service organization, University Services will continue to set a high bar for approving regular remote work schedules. However, I would encourage those interested in FWAs to review HR policy 5.1.4 Flexible Work Arrangements(Link is external) and a related set of FAQs(Link is external) and to discuss with their managers.

Note that per HR policy, the University continues to encourage supervisors to permit reasonable flexibility in the normal course of business and operations to accommodate the periodic needs of individuals to manage personal affairs, aside from formal recurring flexible work arrangements/remote arrangements. Consequently, the exception criteria do not intend to cover ad hoc requests by an employee to work remotely (e.g., working at home while waiting for a delivery). Instead, the exception criteria apply to requests for routine or regularly recurring remote work arrangements that exceed one day of remote work per week.

I feel optimistic that this revision to the policy will further strengthen our ability to work collaboratively with each other and with our campus partners.

Thank you for your unwavering commitment to service for the Princeton community.

I am currently conducting research for my honors thesis, titled “AI in Shadows,” which explores the evolution of North Korea’s cyber activities from 2009 to 2024, with a focus on the role of AI in cyberwarfare.
I was recommended I speak to you by Stephen Kotkin and Rachel George - they mentioned you would be a great person to speak to on this topic. Given your expertise and work on North Korea, I would greatly value the opportunity to hear your insights and perspectives on any of the following: North Korean cyber operations and how they have evolved, and recommendations for US and global cyber defence, especially in light of increasing AI use. 
My thesis aims to address critical questions such as:
What is the current state of US and global cybersecurity in response to state-sponsored attacks?
How does North Korea’s state-sponsored cyber operations differ from other actors, such as China and Russia?
How has North Korean cyber operations evolved over time?
How does the rise of AI amplify the urgency of addressing cyber threats? And how should we prepare?

I developed an interest in this topic through my research work with the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, where I contributed to reports with UN Special Rapporteurs and published a dedicated project on North Korean cyberwarfare.
The interview would take approximately 30 minutes and can be scheduled at a time convenient for you. I am happy to accommodate your availability and conduct the interview over Zoom or phone call, whichever you prefer. 
Thank you so much for considering my request. Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or require further information about my research. I look forward to the possibility of learning from your expertise.

Thank you for donating to the Wikimedia Foundation. You are wonderful!

It’s easy to ignore our fundraising banners, and I’m really glad you didn’t. This is how Wikipedia pays its bills — people like you giving us money, so we can keep the site freely available for everyone around the world.

People tell me they donate to Wikipedia because they find it useful, and they trust it because even though it’s not perfect, they know it’s written for them. Wikipedia isn’t meant to advance somebody’s PR agenda or push a particular ideology, or to persuade you to believe something that’s not true. We aim to tell the truth, and we can do that because of you. The fact that you fund the site keeps us independent and able to deliver what you need and want from Wikipedia. Exactly as it should be.

You should know: your donation isn’t just covering your own costs. The average donor is paying for his or her own use of Wikipedia, plus the costs of hundreds of other people. Your donation keeps Wikipedia available for an ambitious kid in Bangalore who’s teaching herself computer programming. A middle-aged homemaker in Vienna who’s just been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. A novelist researching 1850s Britain. A 10-year-old in San Salvador who’s just discovered Carl Sagan.

On behalf of those people, and the half-billion other readers of Wikipedia and its sister sites and projects, I thank you for joining us in our effort to make the sum of all human knowledge available for everyone. Your donation makes the world a better place. Thank you.

Most people don’t know Wikipedia’s run by a non-profit. Please consider sharing this e-mail with a few of your friends to encourage them to donate too. And if you’re interested, you should try adding some new information to Wikipedia. If you see a typo or other small mistake, please fix it, and if you find something missing, please add it. There are resources here that can help you get started. Don’t worry about making a mistake: that’s normal when people first start editing and if it happens, other Wikipedians will be happy to fix it for you.

I appreciate your trust in us, and I promise you we’ll use your money well.

We are writing to inform you of a technical issue caused by a software 
update, which affected Google+ APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) 
between November 7th, 2018 PT and November 13th, 2018 PT when the issue 
was fixed. We have determined that the impact of this technical issue was 
limited to Google+ APIs that return profile information about users and 
resulted in two potential unintended effects:

-If you granted an app permission to view your profile information, 
such as name, email address, occupation, the app inadvertently was able 
to request and view more profile fields than you granted the app 
permission to view.

-If a person with whom you had shared profile information granted an app 
permission to view your public profile fields, that app was able to 
request and view your public profile fields, as intended, but 
inadvertently was also able to request and view any profile fields you 
had shared with that person, including profile fields that you had sharedwith that person but not shared publicly.

This issue was limited to profile fields and did not give developers 
access to information such as financial data, national identification 
numbers, passwords, or similar data typically used for fraud or identity 
theft.

The issue was detected by our automated testing and fixed on November 13th
2018 PT. We have no evidence that the app developers who inadvertently 
had this access for six days were aware of it or misused it in any way.

For your information, we are attaching a list of the affected fields and 
the corresponding app names (where available). For a list of all 
third-party apps you have granted access to your account, please review 
your security preferences - Third-party apps with account access.

Please note that this issue was discussed in the Google+ blog post dated

caused. If you have any questions please contact us via this form.
